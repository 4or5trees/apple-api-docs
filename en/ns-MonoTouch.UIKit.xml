    <summary>User Interface APIs for MonoTouch.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	MonoTouch.UIKit is a binding to CocoaTouch's widget set.  Use
	the classes in this space to create native user interfaces with
	iOS UIKit.

	iOS Applications start as instances of the UIApplication
	class, they can either be an instance of UIApplication or a
	subclass of <see cref="T:MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication"/>.
	This UIApplication object will invoke a number of methods in
	response to starting up, shutting down, going to the
	background and other interesting events by calling methods on
	an instace of the <see
	cref="T:MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplicationDelegate"/> class.  Most
	applications will override the <see
	cref="M:MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplicationDelegate.FinishedLaunching"
	/> which is responsible for creating the main <see
	cref="T:MonoTouch.UIKit.UIWindow"/> and configuring the
	topmost <see cref="T:MonoTouch.UIKit.UIViewController"/> to
	display.

      </para>

	Most applications will create a single <see
	cref="T:MonoTouch.UIKit.UIWindow"/>, windows work in concert
	with <see cref="T:MonoTouch.UIKit.UIViewController"/> objects
	which are in charge of orchestrating multiple views, handle
	rotation and handle various events for you.  This is why on
	startup, you must create both a window and sets its root view
	controller, like this:

      </para>

<example>
<code lang="c#">
[Register ("AppDelegate")]
public partial class AppDelegate : UIApplicationDelegate
{
	UIWindow window;

	public override bool FinishedLaunching (UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)
	{
		window = new UIWindow (UIScreen.MainScreen.Bounds);
		window.RootViewController = new UIViewController ();
		window.MakeKeyAndVisible ();
		
		return true;
	}
}
</code>
</example>

      <para>

	Response to user input is implement in UIKit by sublcasses of
	<see cref="T:MonoTouch.UIKit.UIResponder"/>: UIApplication,
	UIViewControllers and their subclasses and UIView and their
	subclasses all inherit from this class.
      </para>
