       <para>
	 This namespace contains a binding to the two-dimensional,
	 bitmap and vector graphic APIs.  To learn more about the
	 capabilities of MonoTouch.CoreGraphics you can read Apple's

      <para>Many graphics use-cases can be addressed using higher-level APIs such as those provided in <see cref="N:MonoTouch.UIKit"/>, <see cref="N:MonoTouch.GLKit"/>, and <see cref="N:MonoTouch.SpriteKit"/>. However, some Core Graphics classes such as <see cref="T:MonoTouch.CoreGraphics.CGLayer"/>, <see cref="T:MonoTouch.CoreGraphics.CGContext"/>, and <see cref="T:MonoTouch.CoreGraphics.CGImage"/> are not uncommonly seen in general UI tasks. In such situations, the Core Graphics class will often have more flexibility in terms of lower-level manipulation but requires more attention from the developer in terms of resource and state management.</para>
